# hello-world
First Repository EVER!!

So, This is the hello-world of repositories, and I, Julian, plan on finishing some pre-work for my Vanderbilt coding Bootcamp.

I'm just starting out on this, and may have NO IDEA what I got myself into. This is going to be a short 6-month ride, though intense, and should be fun.
